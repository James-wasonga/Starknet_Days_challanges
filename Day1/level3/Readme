 - Its STARK proof system has the potential to revolutionize the blockchain industry by enabling significantly higher throughput and lower costs.

## How StarkEx leverage STARK proofs to ensure the validity of large batches of transactions off-chain
 The off-chain Prover processes large batches of transactions and generates a STARK proof. The on-chain Verifier checks the STARK proof in a few computational steps. This enables massive scaling off-chain, where we process large computations whose integrity is then enforced on-chain with minimal computation.
