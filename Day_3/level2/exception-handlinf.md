# importance of exception handling

- help you address potential issues within your code
- makes it easier to create programs that are adaptable and maintainable
- we have a situation with the panic function whereby it does not provide a resolution of this errors but it acknowledges them by making the program panic
- exception handling would be useful in cairo in situations such as arithmetic where we would expect a signed negative integer in an unsigned data  type which as for now does not exist
